### Arrays/Linked Lists Exercises

We’ve supplied you with a Node class and a constructor for the LinkedList class. 
Here are descriptions of the methods you should write for instances of LinkedList:

#### push(val)
Appends a new node with value val to the tail. Returns undefined.

#### unshift(val)
Add a new node with value val to the head. Returns undefined.

#### pop()
Remove & return tail value. Throws error if list is empty.

#### shift()
Remove & return head value. Throws error if list is empty.

#### getAt(idx)
Retrieve value at index position idx. Throws error if index is invalid.

#### setAt(idx, val)
Set value of node at index position idx to val. Throws error if index is invalid.

#### insertAt(idx, val)
Insert a new node at position idx with value val. Throws error if index is invalid. Returns undefined.

#### removeAt(idx)
Remove & return value at position idx. Throws error if index is invalid.

Go Slow & Check Your Code!

It’s very easy to make methods that don’t work for every case — make sure you properly handle cases of items being at the start, 
middle, or end of the list, as well as handling empty lists.

### Average Of List
Given a linked list containing numbers, return the average of those numbers.
